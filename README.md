**0. Introduction**

There are lots of fitness apps... but do you always have motivation to use them? Our app will connect all your devices: Android wear, Android TV, and your smartphone/tablet, to encourage you to exercise! 

*It would be the best health app out there! We hope you are happy with it.*

You go out of home location, the app starts tracking your steps throughout the day, and when you come back home, it will match your steps with your goald and encourage you to reach that, or congratulate you otherwise. It will play training video on your smartphone/tablet as well as on Android TV if you want, to help you.
